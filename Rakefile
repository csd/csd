============================================================

  Thank you for installing the TTA Automated Installer!

  You can run it by typing `aiÂ´ in your command line.

  NOTE: On DEBIAN and UBUNTU the executable `aiÂ´ is *maybe*
        not in your PATH by default. If that is the case,
        you can fix it by running this command:

  echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(gem env | grep "E D" | sed "s/[^\w]* //")" >> ~/.bashrc;. ~/.bashrc
